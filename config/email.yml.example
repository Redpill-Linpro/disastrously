#   domain - If you need to specify a HELO domain, you can do it here.
#   user_name - If your mail server requires authentication, set the username in this setting.
#   password - If your mail server requires authentication, set the password in this setting.
#   authentication - If your mail server requires authentication, you need to specify the authentication type here.
#                    This is one of plain, login, cram_md5.
#   enable_starttls_auto - When set to true, detects if STARTTLS is enabled in your SMTP server and starts to use it.
#                          It works only on Ruby >= 1.8.7 and Ruby >= 1.9. Default is true.
