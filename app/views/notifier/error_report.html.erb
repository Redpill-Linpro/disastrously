Failed to create incident report delivery for group "<%= @group.name %>".
The mail was unsuccessfully sendt to "<%= @group.notification_mail %>".

Please correct the problem to prevent this from happening again.

The incident that failed to deliver was "<%= @incident.title %>":
<%= "#{admin_incidents_url}?id=#{@incident.id}" %>

<% if delivery.errors.any? -%>
  The reported errors were:

  <% delivery.errors.each_full do |error| -%>
    <%= error %>
  <% end -%>
<% end -%>

You can correct the problem and then make an empty update to the incident to
create new notifications (notice that those that previously got notifications
will receive duplicates).
