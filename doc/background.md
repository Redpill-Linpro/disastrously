# Incident Tracker

Even though the system operators who manage and maintain the IT systems for a
company are skilled at their work, there is always a chance for unexpected
events to interfere with normal operations of one or more systems, or required
maintenance that must take place which also affect normal operations.

When systems grow in size and complexity it becomes important to systimatically
track events that interfere with any of those systems, and it becomes even more
important if some of those systems belong to clients. In addition to tracking
Service Level Agreement (percentage of uptime on a system - SLA) it is also
convenient to log what happened and what was done to remedy the situation for
each event.

# Disastrously

Disastrously is an incident tracker written to be used in house by [Redpill
Linpro](http://redpill-linpro.com), an open source oriented service provider.

It was decided to open source Disastrously under a free license in the hope
that it might be useful for others. It is still being actively used by Redpill
Linpro to report anomalities with their clients systems.

Disastrously was originally started in the summer of 2009 and put into
production after about half a years work by a single developer. It did its job
adequitely and received intermitten development. In 2011 full time development
was resumed, resulting in release of the source code in the summer of 2011.
